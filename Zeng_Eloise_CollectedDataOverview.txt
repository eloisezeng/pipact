I collected data for seven days from 7-11-2020 to 7-18-2020. The data is stored in Zeng_Eloise_CollectedData.zip

The 21 folder names tell the day and the military time at the hour. 

There are eight csv files in each folder. The first seven are scanning data. 
The last one, info.csv, has the humidity and temperature at each distance. 

The Raspberry Pi's advertised and scanned for 60 seconds at distances of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 ft. 
I started a convenient naming convention for the csv files from day2t17 and onwards. 
The files are titled f!t@d#. ! is the distance between the Raspberry Pis. @ is the time to the hour. # is the day.

pi_pact_data_ft.csv contains the distance (ft) between the pis, relative humidity, temperature in Fahrenheit, and mean RSSI for each scanning period of 60 seconds.

pi_pact_data.csv contains whether the pis were less than or equal to six feet apart (1 if true, 0 if false), relative humidity, temperature in Fahrenheit, and mean RSSI for each scanning period of 60 seconds.
